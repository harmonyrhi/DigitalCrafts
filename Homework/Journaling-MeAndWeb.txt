Now that you've learned a bit about what to expect in the course and have seen some of the jobs in the Web Development Industry, where do you see yourself at the end of your 14-week journey?

What about 6 months from now?

or 1 year from now?

Are you excited? Scared? Eager?

What do you hope to accomplish?

Can you foresee potential roadblocks?

What can be done to prevent or circumvent them?

Is there something that I, as your instructor, can do to help you on the road to success?
